# Store Dashboard
  This is a dashboard created using Angular 7, Angular Material, ngx-chart. It's a purely UI codebase and for time being for local storage I am using Browser storage. 

## Things to do

1) `npm install` : It is a Node project and we are using npm for dependency managment
2) `ng build` : Build Angular project
3) `ng serve` : Start the Angular server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`


## Demo Route
`http://localhost:4200`

## Help

To make the application up and running you need to get the csv file and import the data using `Import` option of application.

To See the data related to each store click on grid row.

The grids has functionality of Search/Sort.

For storing data , we are using localstorage (which is not a good option) but as this is a simple POC i am keeping it there. Ideally data should be load thorough APIS.
